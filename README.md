# Overview
DENTIST (Detecting Errors iN analyses of summary staTISTics) is a QC tool for summary-data-based analyses (analyses based on summary statistics from association studies), given that such analyses are susceptible to errors in summary statistics originated from genotyping/imputation errors or other artifacts and model misspecification due to data heterogeneity, in particular, between the LD reference sample and sample used for the association study. Our paper has summarized the errors and data heterogeneity on several commonly used analyses (namely COJO, SMR HEIDI test and LD score regression), and how much improvement can be attained using DENTIST.
